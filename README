Author: Pierre Damien (UCLA)
Description: A suite of MATLAB scripts developed to evaluate ROMS and biogeochemical model outputs. This toolbox provides post-processing, diagnostics, and comparison with observational datasets.

----------------------------------------

Required MATLAB Packages

1 -  M_MAP
     A MATLAB toolbox for mapping geographic data.

2 -  wesMap colormaps (included)
     Color palettes adapted from Patrick Rafter for aesthetic and effective visualization.

3 -  plot2svg
     Optional: Enables exporting figures in SVG format for high-quality vector graphics.

4 -  CO2SYS-MATLAB
     Required for computing carbonate chemistry variables (e.g., DIC, Alkalinity, pH, Ω).

5 -  Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) Estimation

        GOSML: Adapted from Holte & Talley (2009)
        A New Algorithm for Finding Mixed Layer Depths
